Beagle Bone Black Installation
------------------------------

We are going to set this up to do everything from the sd card.

1.  Download the stock Debian eMMC Flasher image
    -   [Debian (BeagleBone Black - 2GB eMMC) 2014-05-14](http://debian.beagleboard.org/images/BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img.xz)
    -   install to a micro SD card
        -   For OS X: [Pi Filler](http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/)
        -   For Linux:
            -   `sudo xz -cd BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img.xz > /dev/sdb`
        - grab a sandwich
    -   insert micro SD card into unpowered BBB
    -   hold the USER/BOOT button and apply power to BBB
        -   LEDs will begin blinking
        -   wait until all LEDs are stable
    -   unpower BBB and remove micro SD card
    -   plug BBB into a linux or windows machine
        -   it should come up as a usb device named BOOT
    -   delete the file named MLO
    -   this will allow the BBB to always boot from the uSD card if present

2.  Download the regular uSD image
    -   [ubuntu-14.04.1-console-armhf-2014-10-29](https://rcn-ee.net/deb/rootfs/trusty/ubuntu-14.04.1-console-armhf-2014-10-29.tar.xz)
    -   install to a micro SD card
        -   For OS X: [Pi Filler](http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/)
        -   on ubuntu vm:
            -   `tar xvf ubuntu-14.04*`
            -   `cd ubuntu-14.04*`
            -   `sudo fdisk -l`
                -   look for where the uSD card is, eg /dev/sdb
            -   `sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh --mmc /dev/sdb --dtb beaglebone`
        -   grab a sandwich
    -   insert micro SD card into unpowered BBB
    -   apply power to BBB (do NOT hold the USER/BOOT button)
        -   LEDs will begin blinking

3.  login to the BBB
    -   over usb:
        -   `ssh ubuntu@192.168.7.2`
    -   over ethernet:
        -   `ssh ubuntu@arm.local`
    -   u: ubuntu
    -   p: temppwd

4.  Expand the uSD file system

    ``` {.bash}
    $ sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
    p
    d
    2
    n
    p
    2
    <enter>
    <enter>
    w
    $ sudo reboot

    # once the system is rebooted, ssh back in
    $ sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
    ```

5.  configure ethernet
    -   `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`

        ``` {.bash}
        auto eth0
        allow-hotplug eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp

        auto wlan0
        allow-hotplug wlan0
        iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        ```

6.  set hostname
    -   `sudo nano /etc/hostname`
        -   gcs or gcs0001
    -   `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
        -   ``` {.bash}
            127.0.0.1       localhost
            127.0.1.1       gcs
            ```

7.  `sudo reboot`

8.  install packages
    -   update repos
        -   `sudo apt-get update`
    -   bash autocompletion
        -   `sudo apt-get install bash-completion`
    -   vim
        -   `sudo apt-get install vim`
    -   nodejs and npm
        -   `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`
        -   `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`
    -   GCS software prerequisites
        -   `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`

        -   `sudo pip install mapproxy`
    -   Adafruit BBB Python IO Library
        -   `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools python-pip python-smbus`
        -   `sudo pip install Adafruit_BBIO`
            -   test that it works
                `sudo python -c "import Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO as GPIO; print GPIO"`

            -   you should see this or similar:
                ``` {.bash}
                <module 'Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO' from '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Adafruit_BBIO/GPIO.so'>
                ```

9.  install gpsd and ntp `sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients ntp`

10. edit gpsd and ntp

    ``` {.bash}
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd
    cat /etc/default/gpsd

    # Default settings for gpsd.
    # Please do not edit this file directly - use `dpkg-reconfigure gpsd' to
    # change the options.
    START_DAEMON="true"
    GPSD_OPTIONS="-n -G"
    DEVICES="/dev/ttyO4"
    BAUDRATE="9600"
    USBAUTO="false"
    GPSD_SOCKET="/var/run/gpsd.sock"
    ```

11. connect gps unit to the following pins
    -   tx -\> P9.11
    -   rx -\> P9.13
    -   ground -\> P9.1
    -   power -\> P9.3

12. edit uEnv.txt
    -   the latest BBB images use kernel >= 3.14
        - the cape manager is no longer available
    -   `sudo vim /boot/uEnv.txt`
    -   change `#dtb=` to `dtb=am335x-boneblack-ttyO4.dtb`
    -   `sudo reboot`

13. verify gpsd is working
    -   `ubuntu@arm:~$ cgps`
    -   you should see a table output with something updating roughly
        every second

15. turn off apache
    -   `sudo update-rc.d -f apache2 disable`
    -   `sudo reboot`
    -   `sudo ps -aux | grep apache | grep -v grep`
        -   should come back empty

        -   or follow the guide from
            [github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
    -   clone the directory
        -   `git clone git@github.com:arctic-fire-development/dapper-gcs.git`

        ``` {.bash}
        sudo rm -rf tmp
        cd dapper-gcs
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
        npm install
        bower install
        grunt
        ```

    -   copy over the upstart script

            ```

        -   `sudo service dapper-gcs start`

3.  clean up any ssh files
    -   delete .ssh directory
    -   delete .gitconfig

### Backup uSD card

We are going to load up a usb flash drive to the BBB, and then use dd
and bzip2 to make a compressed image of the uSD card

1.  bootup the BBB
2.  insert the usb drive
3.  `sudo fdisk -l` `output` notice the usb is located at /dev/sda1
    notice the uSD card is /dev/mmcblk0
4.  from home directory `mkdir usb0`
5.  become root `sudo su -`
6.  mount the usb drive to the folder we just made

        mount -t vfat -o uid=ubuntu,gid=ubuntu /dev/sda1 /home/ubuntu/usb0
        exit

7.  make the image
    `sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | pv -s 2G -petr | gzip -1 > ./usb0/BBB-ubuntu-14.04-ArcticFireGCS.img.gz`
8.  remove the usb drive `sudo umount /home/ubuntu/usb0`
9.  profit

### Troubleshooting

#### OS X doesn't recognize the BBB in network interfaces anymore

##### First go around

    ```
    Today i started configuring my beaglebone board. While the first time after installing the USB driver and the tethering HoRNDIS driver, it soon stopped working. I ended up getting multiple entries in my network configuration.

    This will fix the issue:

    Edit these two files and remove all entries containing beagleboard (beginning with <key>, including the following <dict> entry until </dict>). Do  this for every key/dict pair that holds a “Beagle” propery/string. – After removing all these from the two .plist files, i rebooted, and it was immediately working again! if i would have known this, i would have saved lots of time reinstalling the drivers again and again … ;-)

    /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist

    /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
    ```

##### Second go around

    ```
    I have solved this problem by resetting the SMC and the PRAM. Here are the details if someone needs it:

    Reset the SMC and PRAM
    - SMC Reset:
        - Shut down the MacBook Pro.
        - Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.
        - On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.
        - Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.
        - Press the power button to turn on the computer.
    - PRAM:
        - Shut down the MacBook Pro.
        - Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command, Option, P, and R.
        - Turn on the computer.
        - Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys. You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears.
        - Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.
        - Release the keys.
    - After following the above two steps I plugged in the beaglebone and it was detected in the network interface. I was then able to successfully ssh into it.
    ```
