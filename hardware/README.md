##Beagle Bone Black Installation

We are going to set this up to do everything from the sd card.

This will require:

    - flashing the eMMC to RobertCNelson's modified uBoot
    - installing ubuntu on the uSD card

1. Download the eMMC Flasher image
    - [BBB-eMMC-flasher-ubuntu-14.04-console-armhf-2014-08-13-2gb](http://rcn-ee.net/deb/flasher/trusty/BBB-eMMC-flasher-ubuntu-14.04-console-armhf-2014-08-13-2gb.img.xz)
    - install to a micro SD card
    - insert micro SD card into unpowered BBB
    - hold the USER/BOOT button and apply power to BBB
        - LEDs will begin blinking
        - wait until all LEDs are stable
    - unpower BBB and remove micro SD card

2. Download the regular uSD image
    - [ubuntu-14.04-console-armhf-2014-08-13](https://rcn-ee.net/deb/rootfs/trusty/ubuntu-14.04-console-armhf-2014-08-13.tar.xz)
    - install to a micro SD card
        - For OS X: [Pi Filler](http://ivanx.com/raspberrypi/)
        - on ubuntu vm:
            - `tar xvf ubuntu-14.04*`
            - `cd ubuntu-14.04*`
            - `sudo fdisk -l`
                - look for where the uSD card is, eg /dev/sdb
            - `sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh --mmc /dev/sdb --dtb beaglebone`
            - grab a sandwhich
    - insert micro SD card into unpowered BBB
    - apply power to BBB (do NOT hold the USER/BOOT button)
        - LEDs will begin blinking

3. login to the BBB
    - over usb:
        - `ssh ubuntu@192.168.7.2`
    - over ethernet:
        - `ssh ubuntu@arm.local`
    - u: ubuntu
    - p: temppwd

4. Expand the uSD file system
    ```bash
    $ sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
    p
    d
    2
    n
    p
    2
    <enter>
    <enter>
    w
    $ sudo reboot

    # once the system is rebooted, ssh back in
    $ sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
    ```

5. configure ethernet
    - ```sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces```

        ```bash
        auto eth0
        allow-hotplug eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp
        ```

6. set hostname
    - ```sudo nano /etc/hostname```
        - gcs or gcs0001
    - ```sudo nano /etc/hosts```
        - same as above

7. configure avahi-daemon
    - ```sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon```
    - ```sudo update-rc.d avahi-daemon defaults```
    - Create a configuration file containing information about the server. Run ```sudo nano /etc/avahi/services/afpd.service```. Enter (or copy/paste) the following

        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?><!--*-nxml-*-->
        <!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">
        <service-group>
            <name replace-wildcards="yes">%h</name>
            <service>
                <type>_afpovertcp._tcp</type>

                ```bash
                ubuntu@arm:~$ sudo python -c "import Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO as GPIO; print GPIO"

                you should see this or similar:
                <module 'Adafruit_BBIO.GPIO' from '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Adafruit_BBIO/GPIO.so'>
                ```

10. install gpsd and ntp
    `sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients ntp`

11. edit gpsd and ntp

    ```bash
    ubuntu@arm:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure gpsd
    ubuntu@arm:~$ cat /etc/default/gpsd

    # Default settings for gpsd.
    # Please do not edit this file directly - use `dpkg-reconfigure gpsd' to
    # change the options.
    START_DAEMON="true"
    GPSD_OPTIONS="-n -G"
    DEVICES="/dev/ttyO4"
    BAUDRATE="9600"
    USBAUTO="false"
    GPSD_SOCKET="/var/run/gpsd.sock"
    ```
12. connect gps unit to the following pins
    - tx -> P9.11
    - rx -> P9.13
    - ground -> P9.1
    - power -> P9.3

13. edit uEnv.txt
    - `sudo vim /boot/uEnv.txt`
    - edit the optargs line, adding this line if required:
        ```bash
        cape_disable=capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G
        cape_enable=capemgr.enable_partno=BB-UART4
        ```
    - `mkdir mmcblk0p1`
    - `sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 ./mmcblk0p1`
    - `sudo cp /boot/uEnv.txt ./mmcblk0p1/`

14. verify gpsd is working
    - `ubuntu@arm:~$ cgps`
    - you should see a table output with something updating roughly every second

16. turn off the damned governor
    - `sudo vim /etc/init.d/ondemand`
    - edit ondemand to be performance
        ```bash
        *ondemand*)
            GOVERNOR="performance"  # <---- originally was "ondemand"
            break
        ```
    - `sudo reboot`
    - verify it took hold
        - ```sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq```
            - ```1000000```
        - ```sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor```
            - ```performance```
        - notice CPU frequency is 1000Mhz and governor is set to performance

17. hostapd
    - [follow these instructions from adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-wifi-access-point/install-software)
        - [custom build hostapd from here](https://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-wifi-access-point/compiling-hostapd)
        - will need to `sudo apt-get install unzip`
18. turn off apache
    - `sudo update-rc.d -f apache2 disable`
    - `sudo reboot`
    - `sudo ps -aux | grep apache | grep -v grep`
        - should come back empty

### Post System Installation

1. set some preferences
    - `vim .bashrc`
        - uncomment `#force_color_prompt=yes`
    - `vim .profile`
        - add the following:
            ```bash
            if ! shopt -oq posix; then
                if [ -f /etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt ]; then
                    . /etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt
                    export PS1='[\@] \[\033[0;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[0;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")\$ '
                    export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
                    export GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=1
                    export GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=1
                    export GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto"
                fi
            fi
            ```
2. setup gcs
    - add your github public and private keys to ~/.ssh
    - test that you can connect to github
        - `ssh -T git@github.com`
        - or follow the guide from [github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)
    - clone the directory
        - `git clone git@github.com:arctic-fire-development/dapper-gcs.git`

        ```bash
        cd dapper-gcs
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
        npm install
        bower install
        grunt
        ```
    - copy over the upstart script
        - `sudo cp dapper-gcs.conf /etc/init/`
        - `cp config.json config`
        - `vim config.json`
            ```bash
            "connection" : {
                "type": "serial",`
            ```

            ```bash
              "serial" : {
                "device" : "/dev/tty.usbserial-A900XUV3",
            ```
        - `sudo start dapper-gcs`

3. clean up any ssh files
    - delete .ssh directory
    - delete .gitconfig

### Backup uSD card
We are going to load up a usb flash drive to the BBB, and then use dd and bzip2 to make a compressed image of the uSD card

1. bootup the BBB
2. insert the usb drive
3. ```sudo fdisk -l```
    ```output```
    notice the usb is located at /dev/sda1
    notice the uSD card is /dev/mmcblk0
4. from home directory
    ```mkdir usb0```
5. become root
    ```sudo su -```
6. mount the usb drive to the folder we just made
    ```
    mount -t vfat -o uid=ubuntu,gid=ubuntu /dev/sda1 /home/ubuntu/usb0
    exit
    ```
7. make the image
    ```sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | pv -s 2G -petr | gzip -1 > ./usb0/BBB-ubuntu-14.04-ArcticFireGCS.img.gz```
8. remove the usb drive
    ```sudo umount /home/ubuntu/usb0```
9. profit

### Troubleshooting

#### OS X doesn't recognize the BBB in network interfaces anymore

##### First go around

    ```
    Today i started configuring my beaglebone board. While the first time after installing the USB driver and the tethering HoRNDIS driver, it soon stopped working. I ended up getting multiple entries in my network configuration.

    This will fix the issue:

    Edit these two files and remove all entries containing beagleboard (beginning with <key>, including the following <dict> entry until </dict>). Do  this for every key/dict pair that holds a “Beagle” propery/string. – After removing all these from the two .plist files, i rebooted, and it was immediately working again! if i would have known this, i would have saved lots of time reinstalling the drivers again and again … ;-)

    /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist

    /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
    ```

##### Second go around

    ```
    I have solved this problem by resetting the SMC and the PRAM. Here are the details if someone needs it:

    Reset the SMC and PRAM
    - SMC Reset:
        - Shut down the MacBook Pro.
        - Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.
        - On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.
        - Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.
        - Press the power button to turn on the computer.
    - PRAM:
        - Shut down the MacBook Pro.
        - Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command, Option, P, and R.
        - Turn on the computer.
        - Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys. You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears.
        - Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.
        - Release the keys.
    - After following the above two steps I plugged in the beaglebone and it was detected in the network interface. I was then able to successfully ssh into it.
    ```
